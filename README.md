Creating Pokemon cards

This JavaScript code fetches and displays a list of 150 Pokémon from the PokéAPI.
It creates visual cards for each Pokémon, showing their name, ID, image, and type. 
The background color of each card is dynamically set based on the Pokémon's primary type, 
using a predefined set of colors associated with different Pokémon types (like fire, water, grass, etc.).
